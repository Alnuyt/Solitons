# Korteweg-de Vries Equation and Solitons (Spectral Method)
This project, carried out in groups as part of the **LPHYS1303** course, uses a **spectral method** to numerically solve the **Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation**, which models the propagation of **solitons**.
## Description
The **Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation** is a **non-linear partial differential equation** representing the evolution of a solitary wave in a dispersive medium. This project aims to:
- Implement a **spectral method** based on the **Fourier transform**.
- Simulate the propagation of two **solitons** and observe their interaction.
- Compare the numerical solution with the analytical solution.
- Evaluate the mean **quadratic error** between the solutions.
## Usage
Run the script to observe the propagation of solitons: [Spectral.py](Spectral.py)
## Results
- **Simulation of soliton propagation:** visualisation of their movement and interaction.
- **Study of the collision:** analysis of changes in the solitons after interaction.
- **Numerical vs analytical comparison:** highlighting of discrepancies due to non-linear terms.
- **Mean square error:** measurement of the divergence between the analytical and numerical solutions.
